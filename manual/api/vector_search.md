## Vecoter Search
We have developed vector search functionality as an extension for SeaSearch. The following introduces the related APIs.

### Creating a Vector Index
To use the vector search feature, you must create a vector index. This can be done via mapping.

For example, we create an index and set the vector field in the document data to be written as "vec". The index type is set to `flat` and the vector dimension is `768`.

```
[PUT] /es/${indexName}/_mapping

body:
{
  "properties": {
    "vec": {
      "type": "vector",
      "dims": 768,
      "vec_index_type": "flat"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Parameter Description:
- ${indexName}: The name of the index.
- type: Fixed as `vector`, indicating that this is a vector index.
- dims: The vector dimension.
- m: A parameter required for the `ivf_pq` index, it must be divisible by dims. For example, the `dims` is `768`, the `m` could be `192`.
- nbits: A parameter required for the `ivf_pq` index, must grater than 0, we recommend `4` or `8`.
- vec_index_type: The index type. Supported types are `flat` and `ivf_pq`.

### Indexing Documents Containing Vectors

Indexing a document that includes vectors is identical at the API level to indexing a regular document. 
You may choose the method that best suits your needs. The following example uses the bulk API.

```
[POST] /es/_bulk

{ "index" : { "_index" : "index1" } }
{"name": "jack1", "vec": [10.2, 10.41, 9.5, 22.2]}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "index1" } }
{"name": "jack2", "vec": [10.2, 11.41, 9.5, 22.2]}
{ "index" : { "_index" : "index1" } }
{"name": "jack3", "vec": [10.2, 12.41, 9.5, 22.2]}
```

!!! warning 
  The _bulk API strictly requires that each line adheres to the formatâ€”data must not span multiple lines. 
  Please refer to the ES bulk documentation for further details. For modifications and deletions, you can also use the bulk API. 
  When a document is deleted, its corresponding vector data will be removed as well.

### Searching Vectors

You can search the system for the top N similar vectors and return the corresponding document information.

```
[POST] /api/${indexName}/_search/vector

{
  "query_field": "vec",
  "k": 7,
  "return_fields": ["name"],
  "vector": [10.2, 10.40, 9.5, 22.2, ...],
  "_source": false
}
```
The API response format is the same as that for full-text search.

#### Parameter Description
- ${indexName}: The name of the index.
- query_field: The field in the index to search. This field must be of type vector.
- k: The number of most similar vectors to return.
- return_fields: The names of the fields to return separately.
- vector: The vector used for querying.
- nprobe: Applicable only to the `ivf_pq` index type; it specifies the number of clusters to search. The higher the number, the more accurate the results.
- _source: Controls whether to return the `_source` field. It supports a boolean value or an array specifying which fields to return.

### Recall Query
For vectors of the `ivf_pq` type, you can perform a recall check on the data. You can optimize and adjust your `ivf_pq` index parameters based on the results of this API.

```
[POST] /api/${indexName}/_recall

{
  "field": "vec_001",  
  "k": 10,
  "nprobe": 5,         
  "query_count": 1000
}
```

#### Parameter Description
- ${indexName}: The name of the index.
- field: The field in the index to test. This field must be of type vector.
- k: The number of most similar vectors to return.
- nprobe: The number of nprobe clusters, with default of `5`.
- query_count: The number of tests performed. The higher this number, the more stable the results will be, with a default of 100.

## Example of Using Vector Search

Below is an example demonstrating how to index a batch of papers. 
Each paper may contain multiple vectors that need to be indexed. 
We aim to retrieve the N most similar vectors via vector search and thereby obtain the corresponding `paper-id`.

### Creating the SeaSearch Index and Vector Index

First, set up the mapping for the vector index. When you define the mapping, both the index and the vector index will be created automatically. 
Since `paper-id` is just a plain string and does not require analysis, we set its type to `keyword`.

```
[PUT] /es/paper/_mapping

{
  "properties": {
    "content-vec": {
      "type": "vector",
      "dims": 768,
      "vec_index_type": "flat"      
    },
    "paper-id": {
      "type": "keyword"
    }
  }
}
```
With the above request, an index named `paper` is created, and a `flat` vector index is established for the `content-vec` field.

### Indexing Data

We use the `_bulk` API to batch insert these `paper` data into SeaSearch.

```
[POST] /es/_bulk

{ "index" : {"_index" : "paper" } }
{"paper-id": "001", "content-vec": [10.2, 10.40, 9.5, 22.2, ...]}
{ "index" : {"_index" : "paper" } }
{"paper-id": "002", "content-vec": [10.2, 11.40, 9.5, 22.2, ...]}
{ "index" : {"_index" : "paper" } }
{"paper-id": "003", "content-vec": [10.2, 12.40, 9.5, 22.2, ...]}
```

### Searching Data
Now you can perform a vector search.

```
[POST] /api/paper/_search/vector

{
  "query_field": "content-vec",
  "k": 10,
  "return_fields": ["paper-id"],
  "vector": [10.2, 10.40, 9.5, 22.2, ...]
}
```

This search returns the documents corresponding to the most similar vectors and provides the `paper-id`. 
Note that a paper may contain multiple vectors, if several vectors of the same paper are very similar to the query vector, that `paper-id` might appear multiple times in the results.

### Maintaining Vector Data

#### Directly Updating a Document
After a document is successfully imported, SeaSearch returns its document ID. You can use this doc id to directly update the document.

```
[POST] /es/_bulk

{ "update" : {"_id": "23gZX9eT6QM", "_index": "paper" } }
{"paper-id": "005", "vec": [10.2, 1.43, 9.5, 22.2, ...]}
```

#### Query Then Update

If you did not save the returned doc id, you can first use SeaSearch's full-text search functionality to query the document(s) corresponding to a specific `paper-id`.

```
[POST] /es/paper/_search

{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "term": {"paper-id": "003"}
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Using DSL, you can retrieve the document associated with the `paper-id` along with its doc id.

#### Full Update for a Paper

A paper may contain multiple vectors. If a particular vector needs updating, you can update the document corresponding to that vector directly. 
However, in practice, it can be difficult to distinguish which parts of a paper are new versus which are updates.

A full update approach can be adopted as follows:
1.Use DSL to query all documents for a paper.
2.Delete all of the documents.
3.Import the latest paper data.

Steps 2 and 3 can be executed in a single bulk operation.

The following example demonstrates deleting the documents for paper `001` and re-importing them. 
At the same time, it directly updates paper `005` and paper `006` (since they each have only one vector):

```
[POST] /es/_bulk

{ "delete" : {"_id": "23gZX9eT6Q8", "_index": "paper" } }
{ "delete" : {"_id": "23gZX9eT6Q0", "_index": "paper" } }
{ "delete" : {"_id": "23gZX9eT6Q3", "_index": "paper" } }
{ "index" : {"_index": "paper" } }
{"paper-id": "001", "content-vec": [10.2, 1.41, 9.5, 22.2, ...]}
{ "index" : {"_index": "paper" } }
{"paper-id": "001", "content-vec": [10.2, 1.42, 9.5, 22.2, ...]}
{ "index" : {"_index": "paper" } }
{"paper-id": "001", "content-vec": [10.2, 1.43, 9.5, 22.2, ...]}
{ "update" : {"_id": "23gZX9eT6QM", "_index": "paper" } }
{"paper-id": "005", "content-vec": [10.2, 1.43, 9.5, 22.2, ...]}
{ "update" : {"_id": "23gZX9eT6QY", "_index": "paper" } }
{"paper-id": "006", "content-vec": [10.2, 1.43, 9.5, 22.2, ...]}
```

# Introduction

ZincSearch is a full-text search server implemented in Go language, providing an API compatible with ElasticSearch DSL. It uses Bluge as the indexing engine. Bluge is a fork version of Bleve (developed by CouchBase), a widely used Go language full-text indexing library, which refactors the code to make it more modern and flexible.
